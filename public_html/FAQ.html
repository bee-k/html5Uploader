        <span class="description aligncenter">HTML5Uploader is a file upload script with resumable 
            feature and MySQL backend support</span> 
        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p>
            This is a file upload script.<br>
            You can find it's <a href="">!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!source code on GitHub</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I needed a script which is resumable by default, easily customizable (you can make 'themes') 
            and has a MySQL backend. <br>
            So I combined the powerful <a href="https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload">jQuery-File-Upload plugin</a> with my own ideas.   
            <br>Now I share it here. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Some basics about this uploader: <br>
            Only Javascript is used on the client side, no Flash or Java is required. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            All uploads are resumable (by default) which means you don't have to restart the whole uploading process after a connection loss, just drop the same files again and continue where you left. 
            <br>
            To try it, drop a bigger file or files, start upload, 
            then - during uploading - close your browser, 
            your upload will continue when you start it again. <br>
            In case of older browsers, it will fallback to the old method 
            (it will upload the files in one big chunk).
        </p>
        <p>
            The backend is using MySQL so you will have some work with the database. <br>
            See the following section.
        </p>

        <h3>How to install / integrate with my site?</h3>
        <p>
            Download it from GitHub
            Create the database based on: .....  
            Fill in your MySQL credentials what you can 
            Theming.
        </p>

        <h3>Important things I have to watch out for?</h3>
        <p>
            File uploading is only safe when your server is configured properly. 
            When you are using Apache you must always ensure that .htaccess 
            in the directories are working. Upload a sample script file to see if its 
            interpreted by the your server. ...  You can even move outside from the public_html 
            folder you have to rewrite the upload path inside the server.
        </p>

        <h3>What kind of options available?</h3>    
        <p>
            Because this script is built upon the well known jQuery-File-Upload plugin you can use 
            it's <a href="https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Options">options</a>, but before you change anything you should know what you are doing, 
            so always read about it first before you modify some options.<br>
            In HTML5Uploader the images are not processed at all. 
            Neither in client nor server side. So you can't use the image 
            related options unless you enable (rewite a script a bit) image processing in client/server side..
        </p>

        <h3>More details on 'resumable' uploads?</h3>
        <p>
            Well, by default the script will slice up the files and these small 
            chunks will be sent to the server one by one. So let's call this 'chunking'. 
            These parts will be merged on the server side.
        </p>   
            <p>What are the advantages of this:</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you slice up the files there will be no memory limits. 
                        You can even upload GB-s of data theoretically. 
                        It's useful when you need to upload bigger files to a shared server 
                        (where you can't touch php.ini).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Another useful aspect of chunking is it's resumable, 
                        which means if you have a power outage during the file upload, 
                        or just close the browser / tab, it will simply continue the uploading process 
                        from the latest chunk when you drop the same file(s).
                    </li>
                </ul>
        <p>
            How is this achieved?<br>
            In short: with the Javascript Blob object. This object has a slice() method. For further reference about the API see the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob">MDN article</a> or the official <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#dfn-Blob">w3</a> description about this topic.
